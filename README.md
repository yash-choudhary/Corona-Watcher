# Corona Watcher
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.
The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.

## How it spreads
Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.

So we have created this Android app to monitor the current spread of the virus globaly. 
This application uses realtime data scraped from multiple sources using a **python** based scraper deployed using **Heroku**.
The Scraper is built using **BeautifulSoup4** and api is created using **Flask**.

The source code for this project is open-sourced and anyone can use it with citation to this repo.

## Data Source
We would like to thank the developers and folks at [Johns Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/).
Most of the data in our app is taken from there open sourced datasets.

Info about the Scraper and API endpoints will be released soon...

Thanks for Supporting.
